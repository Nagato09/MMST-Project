# MMST-Project

@Rafal

For the coding enviroment currently im using Atom

The whole Angular project is too big to upload to github at once.

I just uploaded the src directory where all the changes happen.

1. Install everything to get started.
	
	-Atom
	-npm
	-Angular
	
2. After that download the angular project base form whatsapp group or create a default angular project
3. download the src directory from github and replace with the existing src folder



By controling the src folder on github whe will work together on the project (at least thats the plan )


Feel free to append the information to this document.
